Warm-up
-------

Strategy
--------

This character is poor at close range and has weak punch kick attacks. It is
better to keep the opponent at long range (S, HS) and items (236P).

When in trouble and getting caught in combo, cancel out with D+S.

Poking
------

_includes distance control_

Combos
------

Basic combos:
- close range: 5P > cS > 5H/2H > 236S (pogo) > 5H
- long range: 236K (re-re-thrust) > 4 > PKS (roman cancel) > 5H/2H > 236S (pogo) > 5H
- corner: 5P > cS > 5H/2H > 236S (pogo) > 8 (helicopter)
- jump combo: jj > 236P (love) > 2K

NOTE: 214H (hack n slash), unblockable close range attack which replaces grab

NOTE: j.236P (love), reliable item use to control distance or when opponent cornered

Anti-air
--------

Mainly use **2K** instead of 6P as it is more powerful and more convenient in
terms of defenese.
