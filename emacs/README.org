* Emacs setup

I simplified my emacs setup as much as possible (for now). Simply place the
init.el into the .emacs.d/ directory which will point to the git version of the
config.el file containing my settings.

** TODO Customization
   
Simplified custom essentials for increased efficiency of text file editing.
- C-; (prefix for custom commands)
  

Additional packages
- Yasnippets
- Flycheck
- Tags (code navigations)
- Snipe or ace-jump (text editing)
- Gud (debugging)
- Which-key (keybindings cheatsheet)
- Ivy
- ace-window


Essentials:
1. multi-line editing
2. eshell (learn more, efficiency, and configuration)
   - aliases
   - prompt customization
   - shortcuts
   - integration with dired (for improved movement and file management)
   - quick minibuffer command binding
3. goto function definition / variable declaration (see tags)

Misc things to do:
- Major mode for scientific publication search, bib and paper download
  (look at behavior similar to rss feed reader: list of articles above,
  display article abstract + bibtex in window below)
- Backup manager
- Splash screen (dashboard)
